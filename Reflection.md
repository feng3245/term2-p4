At the start of the project I did not know what were the correct values for PID
I started by trying 0.2 3.0 and 0.004 same as the example values used by Sebastien. However this prove to be insufficient. I have experimented with the parameters and having the P value alone does a reasonable job with straight roads but still over shoot with a slightly significant curve that causes CTE to be large. I've then experiments with the D value but not knowing the sufficient value actually causes the car to deviate from the correct course even faster. I've then tried using the value from the twiddle example. The value in the lesson is actually very close to the actual value up to 5-6th digit. I've incorporated twiddle as part of the flow but after the car take off there seems to be not much significant change in the PID values. The car seems to run fine with throttle of 0.1 but will go off track at 0.3. The I value is used to correct systematic bias and it seems there is a reasonably large bias towards the left as the value is positive close to 0.5. Perhaps controllers on throttle and speed as well will improve the performance.
